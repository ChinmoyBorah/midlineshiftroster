```

**Actual Schema has:**

```

```

### 5. ‚ùå Wrong Staff Status

**Actual Schema:**

## üîç How to Verify Everything is Correct

### Check 1: Staff Count

Run in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM staff GROUP BY role;
```

**Expected:**

- doctor: 10
- dental_assistant: 10

### Check 2: Leave Requests

Run in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT
  s.name,
  lr.start_date,
  lr.end_date,
  lr.status
FROM leave_requests lr
JOIN staff s ON lr.staff_id = s.id
ORDER BY lr.start_date;
```

**Expected:**

- Dr. Rachel Kim: 2025-09-30 to 2025-10-01, approved
- Lisa Brown: 2025-10-02 to 2025-10-03, approved
- Maya Patel: 2025-10-05 to 2025-10-06, pending

### Check 3: Shift Assignments

Run in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shift_assignments;
```

**Expected:** 0 (zero)

### Check 4: Staff on Leave for Oct 2, 2025

Run in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT s.name, s.role
FROM staff s
JOIN leave_requests lr ON s.id = lr.staff_id
WHERE '2025-10-02'::date BETWEEN lr.start_date AND lr.end_date
  AND lr.status = 'approved';
```

**Expected:** Lisa Brown (dental_assistant)
