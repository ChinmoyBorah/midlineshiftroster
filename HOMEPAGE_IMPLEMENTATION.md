### Updated Components

1. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**

3. **`frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx`**
   - Added automatic redirect to `/admin/shifts` on successful login
   - Integrated with React Router for navigation
   - Maintains backward compatibility with `onSuccess` callback

4. **`frontend/src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`**
   - Updated all navigation paths to use `/admin/*` prefix:
     - `/shifts` → `/admin/shifts`
     - `/staff` → `/admin/staff`
     - `/leave` → `/admin/leave`

5. **`frontend/src/pages/StaffLeaveApplication.tsx`**
   - Added back-to-home button on both form and success screens
   - Improved navigation flow
   - Added Home and ArrowLeft icons from Lucide

### Documentation Updates

   - Updated routing examples throughout

2. **`Product_spec.md`**
   - Added "Homepage & Navigation" section
   - Described two main user paths
   - Listed design features and benefits
   - Documented navigation flow

## Routing Structure

### Before
```
/ → (redirected to /shifts if authenticated, else showed login)
/shifts → DailyShifts (protected)
/staff → StaffManagement (protected)
/leave → LeaveManagement (protected)
/staff-leave-request → StaffLeaveApplication (public)
```

### After
```
/ → Home (public landing page)
/admin-login → AdminLogin (public)
/staff-leave-request → StaffLeaveApplication (public)
/admin/shifts → DailyShifts (protected)
/admin/staff → StaffManagement (protected)
/admin/leave → LeaveManagement (protected)
```

## User Flows

### Admin User Flow
1. Visit homepage `/`
2. Click "Admin Portal" card
3. Redirect to `/admin-login`
4. Enter credentials and sign in
5. Automatically redirect to `/admin/shifts`
6. Navigate between admin pages using top navigation

### Staff Member Flow
1. Visit homepage `/`
2. Click "Apply for Leave" card
3. Redirect to `/staff-leave-request`
4. Fill out and submit leave request form
5. View success screen with reference number
6. Click "Back to Home" to return to homepage

### Direct Access
- Staff can still access `/staff-leave-request` directly (shareable link)
- Admins accessing protected routes directly will be redirected to `/admin-login`
- After login, admins are sent to `/admin/shifts` dashboard

## Design Highlights

### Homepage Features
- **Gradient Background**: Green theme (`from-[#dcfce7] via-[#bbf7d0] to-[#86efac]`)
- **Header**: Logo, title "Midline Shift Manager", subtitle
- **Welcome Section**: Large heading with descriptive text
- **Two-Column Card Layout**: Side-by-side cards on desktop, stacked on mobile
- **Admin Card**: Indigo gradient header, Shield icon, 4 feature bullet points
- **Staff Card**: Green gradient header, FileText icon, 4 feature bullet points
- **Info Section**: Three feature highlights (24/7 Access, Staff Management, Smart Scheduling)
- **Footer**: Copyright and system name

### Visual Enhancements
- Hover effects on cards (lift animation, shadow increase, border color)
- Icon-based design with Lucide React icons
- Consistent color theming (indigo for admin, green for staff)
- Modern glassmorphism effects (backdrop blur on buttons)
- Responsive grid layout

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- React 18 with TypeScript
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Key Code Patterns

**Navigation with React Router:**
```typescript
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/admin-login'); // Programmatic navigation
```

**Route Protection:**
```typescript
<Route path="/admin/*" element={
  <AuthGuard>
    {/* Protected content */}
  </AuthGuard>
} />
```

**Back Navigation:**
```typescript
<button onClick={() => navigate('/')}>
  <ArrowLeft /> Back to Home
</button>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly at `/`
- [ ] Admin Portal card redirects to `/admin-login`
- [ ] Staff Leave card redirects to `/staff-leave-request`
- [ ] Admin login works and redirects to `/admin/shifts`
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to `/admin-login` when not authenticated
- [ ] Navigation links work correctly in admin dashboard
- [ ] Back-to-home buttons work on admin login page
- [ ] Back-to-home buttons work on staff leave application page
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness (cards stack vertically)
- [ ] Hover effects work on desktop
- [ ] All icons display correctly

## Browser Compatibility

Should work on:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Considerations

- Lightweight component with no heavy dependencies
- Icons loaded from Lucide React (tree-shakeable)
- No external API calls on homepage
- Fast initial load time

## Security Notes

- Homepage is public (no authentication required)
- Admin routes still protected by AuthGuard
- No sensitive data exposed on homepage
- Clear separation between public and protected routes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add system status indicator (online/offline)
- Display total staff count or clinics count
- Add news/announcements section for staff
- Implement QR code generator for staff leave form
- Add language selection (if multi-language support needed)
- Add dark mode toggle

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Vercel will automatically deploy

4. **Verify deployment:**
   - Visit production URL
   - Test all user flows
   - Check mobile responsiveness

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Manual fix:**
   - Revert App.tsx routing changes
   - Remove Home.tsx and AdminLogin.tsx
   - Restore old Navigation.tsx paths

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Admin can't access dashboard after login
**Solution:** Check AuthGuard redirect logic and ensure `/admin/shifts` route exists

**Issue:** Navigation links don't work
**Solution:** Verify Navigation.tsx uses correct `/admin/*` paths

**Issue:** Back buttons not working
**Solution:** Ensure React Router's `useNavigate` is properly imported
