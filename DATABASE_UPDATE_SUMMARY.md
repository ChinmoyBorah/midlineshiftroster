## üöÄ How to Apply These Changes

### Step 1: Backup (Optional but Recommended)

If you have important data:

```sql
-- Backup your current data
SELECT * FROM staff;
SELECT * FROM shift_assignments;
SELECT * FROM leave_requests;
```

### Step 2: Clean Existing Data (If Needed)

If you want a completely fresh start:

```sql
-- Delete all existing data
DELETE FROM shift_assignments;
DELETE FROM leave_requests;
DELETE FROM staff;
DELETE FROM clinics;
```

### Step 3: Run the Updated SQL

1. Open **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the entire contents of `initial_schema_fixed.sql`
4. Paste and run in SQL Editor
5. Check for success messages

**Expected Output:**

```
‚úÖ Schema setup complete! Tables, functions, RLS policies, and initial data have been created.
üìä Initial State:
   ‚Ä¢ 3 Clinics (Central, North, East)
   ‚Ä¢ 20 Staff Members (10 Doctors + 10 Dental Assistants)
   ‚Ä¢ 3 Leave Requests (2 Approved + 1 Pending)
   ‚Ä¢ 0 Shift Assignments (All clinics empty - ready for assignment)
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Note: Public read access is enabled for development. Remove these policies in production.
```

### Step 4: Verify in Supabase

**Check Clinics:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clinics;  -- Should return 3
```

**Check Staff:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staff;  -- Should return 20
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM staff GROUP BY role;
-- Should show: doctor: 10, dental_assistant: 10
```

**Check Leave Requests:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests;  -- Should return 3
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM leave_requests GROUP BY status;
-- Should show: approved: 2, pending: 1
```

**Check Shift Assignments:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shift_assignments;  -- Should return 0
```

### Step 5: Test the Frontend

1. **Refresh your browser** (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
2. **Open console** (F12)
3. **Go to Shifts tab**

**Expected Console Output:**

```javascript
DailyShifts Debug: {
  selectedDate: "2025-10-02",
  allStaffCount: 20,              // ‚úÖ Now 20 instead of 8
  unassignedStaffCount: 18,       // ‚úÖ 18 available (2 on leave)
  // ... detailed staff list
}
```

**Expected UI:**

- **Clinic Roster**: All 3 clinics show "‚ö†Ô∏è No staff assigned"
- **Other Staff**: Shows ~18 staff members (20 total - 2 on leave for Oct 2)

4. **Go to Leave tab**

**Expected:**

- Shows 3 leave requests
- Filter by "Approved" ‚Üí 2 requests
- Filter by "Pending" ‚Üí 1 request

5. **Go to Staff tab**

**Expected:**

- Shows all 20 staff members
- Can edit each staff member
- Can add new staff members

### Test 2: Verify Empty Clinics

2. Check all clinic cards

**Expected:** All 3 clinics show "No staff assigned"

### Test 3: Verify Leave Requests

**Steps:**

1. Go to Leave tab
2. Check total count

**Expected:** Should see 3 leave requests

### Test 4: Assign Staff to Clinic

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Idempotent Operations

The SQL script is designed to be **idempotent**, meaning:

- ‚úÖ Safe to run multiple times
- ‚úÖ Won't create duplicates if data already exists
- ‚úÖ Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks

**However**, if you want a truly clean slate:

```sql
-- Run this first to delete all data
DELETE FROM shift_assignments;
DELETE FROM leave_requests;
DELETE FROM staff;
DELETE FROM clinics;

-- Then re-run the schema file
```

### Data Dependencies

The script maintains proper foreign key relationships:

1. Clinics are created first
2. Staff members reference clinics (primary_clinic_id)
3. Leave requests reference staff (staff_id)
4. Shift assignments would reference both (currently empty)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Only 8 staff showing instead of 20"

**Cause:** Old data still in database

**Solution:**

```sql
DELETE FROM staff;
-- Re-run initial_schema_fixed.sql
```

### Issue: "No leave requests showing"

**Check:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM leave_requests;
```

**If empty, run:**

```sql
-- Re-run the leave requests section from the SQL file
```

### Issue: "Staff already assigned to clinics"

**Cause:** Old shift_assignments data

**Solution:**

```sql
DELETE FROM shift_assignments;
```

### Issue: "Console shows allStaffCount: 0"

**Cause:** Frontend not connected to Supabase or data not inserted

**Check:**

1. Supabase connection in `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts`
2. Verify data in Supabase dashboard
3. Check browser console for errors
