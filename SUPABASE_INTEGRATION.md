# Supabase Integration Complete ✅

The frontend application has been successfully integrated with Supabase backend!

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Service Layer
Created service files for all database operations:
- **`services/clinics.service.ts`** - CRUD operations for clinics
- **`services/staff.service.ts`** - Staff management operations
- **`services/shifts.service.ts`** - Shift assignments and roster management
- **`services/leave.service.ts`** - Leave request operations

### ✅ Custom React Hooks
Created hooks for data fetching with loading and error states:
- **`hooks/useClinics.ts`** - Fetch clinics data
- **`hooks/useStaff.ts`** - Staff CRUD operations
- **`hooks/useShifts.ts`** - Roster and shift management
- **`hooks/useLeave.ts`** - Leave request management

### ✅ Updated Pages
All pages now use real Supabase data:
- **DailyShifts** - Live roster data with loading states
- **StaffManagement** - Real staff data from database  
- **LeaveManagement** - Live leave requests with approve/reject functionality

### ✅ Features Implemented
1. **Real-time data fetching** from Supabase
2. **Loading states** and skeleton loaders
3. **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
4. **Retry mechanisms** for failed requests
5. **Empty states** when no data exists

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend
├── services/           # API calls to Supabase
│   ├── clinics.service.ts
│   ├── staff.service.ts
│   ├── shifts.service.ts
│   └── leave.service.ts
├── hooks/              # React hooks for data management
│   ├── useClinics.ts
│   ├── useStaff.ts
│   ├── useShifts.ts
│   └── useLeave.ts
└── pages/              # Page components
    ├── DailyShifts.tsx
    ├── StaffManagement.tsx
    └── LeaveManagement.tsx
```

## How It Works

### 1. Service Layer
Services abstract all Supabase operations:

```typescript
// Example: Fetching roster
const roster = await ShiftsService.getRosterForDate(date);
```

### 2. Custom Hooks
Hooks manage state, loading, and errors:

```typescript
const { data, loading, error, refetch } = useRosterForDate(selectedDate);
```

### 3. Components
Components use hooks and display data:

```typescript
{loading ? <Skeleton /> : <DataDisplay data={data} />}
```

## Current Functionality

### Daily Shifts Page
- ✅ Fetches real roster data for selected date
- ✅ Shows clinic assignments (doctor + dental assistant)
- ✅ Displays unassigned staff with their status
- ✅ Filter by clinic
- ✅ Date navigation
- ⏳ Assign staff (UI ready, needs modal implementation)

### Staff Management Page
- ✅ Lists all staff members from database
- ✅ Shows role, email, primary clinic, weekly off
- ✅ Active/Inactive status indicators
- ⏳ Add/Edit staff (UI ready, needs modal implementation)

### Leave Management Page
- ✅ Displays all leave requests
- ✅ Filter by status (all/pending/approved/rejected)
- ✅ **Approve leave requests** (fully functional)
- ✅ **Reject leave requests** (fully functional)
- ✅ Shows leave type, date range, reason

## Database Functions Used

The app uses these PostgreSQL functions from Supabase:

1. **`get_clinic_roster_for_date(p_date)`**
   - Returns complete roster for a date
   - Aggregates doctor and dental assistant per clinic
   - Determines status (present/visiting/no_staff)

2. **`get_staff_status_for_date(p_staff_id, p_date)`**
   - Returns staff status for a specific date
   - Checks weekly off, leaves, assignments

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - Modals & Forms
- [ ] Add staff creation modal
- [ ] Edit staff modal
- [ ] Assign staff to shift modal
- [ ] Create leave request modal

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] Authentication with admin login
- [ ] Auto-populate shifts functionality
- [ ] Staff swap/reassignment
- [ ] PDF export of rosters

### Phase 4 - Analytics
- [ ] Staff utilization reports
- [ ] Leave statistics
- [ ] Clinic coverage metrics

## Testing the Application

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. View Daily Shifts
- Navigate to the Shifts tab (default)
- Use date navigator to change dates
- Filter by clinic
- View assigned and unassigned staff

### 3. Manage Staff
- Click the "Staff" tab
- View all staff members
- See their assignments and details

### 4. Manage Leave
- Click the "Leave" tab
- Filter by status
- Approve or reject pending requests

## Database Connection

The app connects to Supabase using:
```typescript
// frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts
export const supabase = createClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);
```

Make sure your `.env.local` has:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Data Flow

```

```

## Error Handling

All operations include error handling:
- Network errors are caught and displayed
- Users can retry failed operations
- Errors don't crash the app
- Friendly error messages for users

## Performance Considerations

- Data is fetched only when needed
- Loading states prevent layout shifts
- Hooks use `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Supabase queries are optimized with proper indexes

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Public read access enabled for development
- Admin operations require authentication (to be implemented)
- All API keys are environment variables

## Troubleshooting

### No data showing
1. Check Supabase connection in browser console
2. Verify database has data (insert sample data if needed)
3. Check RLS policies allow read access

### "Missing Supabase environment variables" error
- Ensure `.env.local` exists in `frontend/` directory
- Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set
- Restart dev server after adding environment variables

### Approve/Reject not working
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify RLS policies allow updates
- Check that leave_requests exist in database

## Success Criteria ✅

- [x] All pages fetch real data from Supabase
- [x] Loading states implemented everywhere
- [x] Error handling with retry functionality
- [x] Leave approval/rejection works
- [x] Staff list displays correctly
- [x] Roster shows current assignments
- [x] Date navigation updates data
- [x] Filter functionality works
- [x] No mock data dependencies

## Conclusion

The application is now fully integrated with Supabase and ready for use! All core functionality is working with real database operations. The next phase would involve adding modals for creating/editing staff and shift assignments.
